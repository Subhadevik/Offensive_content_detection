# Offensive_content_detection

This study presents a strong methodology for detecting offensive content in multilingual text, with a focus on Kannada and Kannada-English mixed comments. The first step in data preprocessing is to work with a dataset containing Kannada comments, which is backed by Google Translate for Kannada-English translation. Following tokenization and sequence labeling, BIO tags are assigned to indicate the existence and bounds of objectionable spans within the text. On annotated data, a Bidirectional LSTM neural network model is trained and BiLSTM modelâ€™s macro F1 score is 61.0 in recognizing objectionable content. Data preparation, model architecture definition, and iterative training with Kannada and KannadaEnglish text are all part of the training process. In a fresh dataset, the trained model accurately predicts offensive spans, emphasizing
comments in the aforementioned languages.Predictions that have been recorded and include offensive span indices are organized into a database.
